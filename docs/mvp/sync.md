So know my goal is: 
To sync development -> production data for my Django platform. 

We should inlcude Projects and all data, associating with it (Parts, Chapters, etc). 

In the future, users will have their progress through projects / parts, but i think we don't need to handle this yet. 

Let's make a step-by-step guide how to sync project-related data from dev to prod and vice versa (but i'm gonna edit my content locally and then push it to prod in the future, development-first approach) 

My project model is located under models/app/project/Project.py
